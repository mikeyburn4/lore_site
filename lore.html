        <h2>You may be wondering how you got here, in fact those were the first words I 
            said as I came out of the womb. You see life is full of gamer moments and this 
            is where I am going to be sharing them with you my prime audience and next to 
            that; you will also help me stop only fans girl gamers. Because they are the 
            reason why so many young men start simping at such a young age when in reality 
            they should just get a cool cat.</h2>
